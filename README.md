# Machine Learning Lab Work

This repository contains the tasks and solutions completed during the Machine Learning subject laboratories. It includes a variety of Jupyter notebooks covering:

- Mathematical equation problems
- Supervised and unsupervised classification tasks
- Beginner to advanced machine learning problems

Each notebook focuses on practical implementation and experimentation using Python and popular ML libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit learn, and more.
